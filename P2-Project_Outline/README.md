## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I am going to build a personal website that looks and functions like a news website (nytimes.com, cnn.com, etc.) using JavaScript. The content is published articles I have written for other publications and links to redirect to the original sources, my resume, my biography, my contact information and more. To contact me, users must send a message directly on my website using an email API. Submitted messages will go directly to my professional gmail address. Videos and photos will be embedded directly into the website without using any third party sources like YouTube or Facebook. Some content will only show the first few lines of my article or column, but require logging in. Users can create an account using a login page. I will use fundamentals from our User-Signup and Blogz assignments, but with JavaScript instead of Python. I will also somehow incorporate genuine ads users can click on so that the website functions like an authentic news site, but I need to figure out how to do this. I could include an advertisement for LaunchCode if permitted. The website will work on desktop/laptop, smart phones and tablets. Ultimately, the content on my website will showcase me as a true multimedia journalist.

My ambition is to become a tech-forward journalist. The journalism industry is shifting towards tech (and online exclusivity in many cases), where reporters and editors need coding skills in addition to traditional storytelling. Most journalists use CMS like WordPress for their personal websites, but I want to demonstrate that I can create websites without depending on sites like WordPress in addition to being a skilled multimedia storyteller. This website would demonstrate all of these skillsets in one, and I will make it clear to potential employers on my website that I built my website from scratch. I will provide a link to my GitHub account and the website repository for employers to look at somewhere in the website. Also, if for some reason I decide to switch to a tech career, I would prove my web developing skills using this website. My goal is to be able to impress not only journalism employers, but also tech employers.

### Features

1: LOGIN REQUIREMENT. Users will have to create an account using specifications I set up and then log in to view certain content. The fundamentals will be similar to User-Signup and Blogz, but with JavaScript instead of Python.

2: EMAIL API. I will set up an email API so that users would message me directly on the page. The messages would go straight to my professional gmail account.

3: ADS. I will incorporate ads and popup content throughout my website so that it replicates an authentic news site. I will need help with this particular portion, but I will see if LaunchCode would be interested in letting me include their ads on my website (for free).

4: SEARCH: Users can search for columns and articles containing given text.
